# Spring 2023 AMS 545 Optional Project: Implementation of KD Trees

To run the program just run KD_Tree_GUI.py for 2D range tree with input points; KD_Tree_GUI_4D.py for 4D range tree with input rectangles. A GUI will pop up. 
For 2D KD Tree, only one check box can be selected at the same time. Both check boxes have to be unselected to generate random points.

KD_Tree_Time.ipynb is used for timing experiments as detailed in the report. 

Requirements: Python 3.7 and above, Jupyter Notebook

Dependencies: matplotlib, numpy, time, statistics
